# Hawky - Revature Social Network Platform

## Project Description
Hawky is a social network based on the character Sokka's messenger hawk from Nickelodeon's Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series; 
our styling was based on the Fire Nation from the same show.
The app allows users to register an account, log in, view previous posts from all other users, add a "like" to their posts,
and view their profiles. Users can also edit their own profile's information and create posts.
